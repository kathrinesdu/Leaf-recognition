<p>Identifying a Weeping Willow is quite easy, even for the average homeowner who is simply looking to enhance his property with the tree's delicate foliage.</p><p>
Among the Weeping Willow's most notable characteristics are:</p> 
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Leaves:</strong> Long and narrow with fine-toothed edges. Each green leaf is attached to a drooping twig, though it appears to be joined to its neighbor. The leaves turn yellow in the fall and some can grow up to eight inches long.</li>
<li><strong>Bark:</strong> Gray, rough and covered with deep ridges and maze-like furrows. The Weeping Willow's bark can turn brittle as it ages.</li>
<li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Long, brown capsules, which contain seeds.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Small, yellow and fuzzy. he one-inch blooms resemble a small caterpillar and usually appear before leaves in the spring.</li></ul>
<p>While most Weeping Willows don't grow beyond 40 feet, most have extra-large umbrella-like canopies that can spread up to 35 feet wide.</p>

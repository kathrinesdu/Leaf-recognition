Birches are enchanting trees that embody beauty and grace. While most types of Birch trees grow to roughly 40 feet, some, such as the Paper and Yellow Birch can soar to 80 feet tall.
Just as the height of the tree varies among species, so do the Birch's other characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leaves:</strong> The leaves of the Birch tree are typically oval to elliptical-shaped. For example, the leaves of the Yellow Birch are oval, while the Gray Birch has more elliptical-shaped leaves. In addition, the leaves range in color from light green to forest green during the summer months. In the fall, the leaves turn a spectacular array of yellow, brown and orange.</li>
<li><strong>Bark:</strong> Birch trees are known for their unique bark. All Birches, except for the Gray Birch, feature peeling barks. The thin bark peels off in long strips. Another identifying trait of Birch tree bark is its color. The young Paper Birch starts off brown but turns chalky white as it ages. Meanwhile, River Birch features a kaleidoscope of colors, including tan, pink, and silver. Birch bark is smooth during its younger years, but gets thick and deeply ridged as the tree matures.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> The Birch tree produces flowers known as catkins. The bloom is long and droops from branches in clusters. The catkins can be seen in the late summer and early fall, though some hang on through the winter.
Birch trees are relatively hardy and can live up to 200 years in the right growing conditions.</li>
